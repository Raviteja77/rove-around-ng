            "description": "This is a must-see place when it comes to New York City. You can catch a ferry to reach here either from Battery Park New York or from Jersey City Liberty State Park. If you are visiting just the liberty statue and Ellis Island, I would recommend catching a ferry from Liberty State Park. The parking is easy and you get less crowd from that side. If you plan to do the entire New York, then Battery Park will be a good option. However, the parking rates are very high. The tickets can be purchased ahead of time or at the counter and watch out for a lot of people selling their tickets for a different ferry, don't fall for tricks. One thing to notice is if you are getting to the counter at around 2:00 p.m. then you can see only one island. Once you purchase the tickets, you go to the ferry onboarding, and based on the season, the lines could get longer. The ferry ride as such is wonderful, and you can get close-up views of the statue when you are in the ferry. Liberty Island is well maintained, and you can get nice pictures of the statue, the skyline of New York City, and beautiful views of the water. If you prefer the pedestal or crown access, you have to plan ahead and book the tickets in advance. There is always a park ranger on duty who gives an overview of the island if you are interested in knowing that history. There are restrooms well maintained. There are cafes  to grab some quick bites. This is definitely one of the places I have visited more than 10 times, and I still love to go here.",

It was said that this iconic monument honours the alliance and friendship between United States and France. The construction of the Statue of Liberty was completed in France itself in 1884. It is made of copper and stands at 305 feet tall! The statue’s torch symbolizes enlightenment… lighting a way to freedom and path to liberty. What an amazing piece of art!",

Walking through the same halls where they once stood is a powerful and humbling experience.\n\nOverall, a visit to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island is not just a tourist attraction; it's a journey through history that leaves a lasting impact and a deeper appreciation for the ideals upon which America was built.

You can book online to get the ticket and choose the Harbor in New Jersey or n New York.\nThis time I choosed departure Harbour in New Jersey. About 45 minuttes drives from Queen and they have huge outdoor car parking.\n\nIt's Affordable trip,  well organized with professional crews, clean area, and beautiful places. Before going to Liberty Statue, we visited the museum of US Immigration.\n\nIn the US Immigration Museum, You can learn about US history here. There are restrooms, Cafe, and Gift Shop in this area. Very interesting gifts for your love one.\n\nThen I'm going to Liberty Statue, waiting the Boat about 15 minutes. There's a Cafe, 2 museums and 1 Gift shop near Harbour. You can enjoy the garden while walking to the Statue of Liberty. It's nice and lovely place 😍😍😍👍👍👍",

No matter what is going on in the world, here we are at peace. And I just want to say the statue is very beautiful and the grounds are very well maintained and they are very environmentally conscious about recycling and using recyclable materials. Which I was not expecting at all. Thank you for a wonderful day!",
